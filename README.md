# Type or Lose Challenge

This little exercise allows you to warm up before writing.

By constantly requiring you to type what your think until your goal of 500 words is reached, you are making sure that the ideas can flow fluidly from your awesome creative brain through your hands and keyboard, and onto your text editor.

You will lose the challenge if you stop typing for 5 seconds. Everything that you’ve typed will disappear and you’ll have to start from scratch again.
